# Getting Your Python On

In this module, you’ll learn about the different types of operating systems, and how you can get your python code ready to interact with the operating system. We’ll learn about getting your environment set up and installing additional Python modules that will help you along the way. We’ll rundown interpreted versus compiled language, and how they differ from each other. We’ll dive into the benefits of automation, and point out common pitfalls so you can avoid them. Finally, we’ll learn about Qwiklabs, which will be used for graded assessments.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify the components and functions of an operating system
- Describe the difference between interpreted and compiled programming languages
- Explain what an IDE (integrated development environment) is
- Install and run Python on a local machine
- List the benefits and pitfalls of automation

### Practice Quiz - Getting Ready for Python

1. Which of the following is the most modern, up-to-date version of Python?

> Python 3

2. Which of the following operating systems is compatible with Python 3?

> All of the above

3. Which of the following operating systems does not run on a Linux kernel?

> Mac OS

4. If we want to check to see  what version of Python is installed, what would we type into the command line? Select all that apply.

> python -V

> python --version

5. What is pip an example of?

> A Python package manager

### Practice Quiz - Running Python Locally

1. When your IDE automatically creates an indent for you, this is known as what?

> Code completion

2. Can you identify the error in the following code?

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import numpy as np

def numpyArray():
    x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)
    y = numpy.array([[3, 6, 2], [9, 12, 8]], np.int32)
    return x*y
print(numpyArray())

```

> The y variable is not calling the numpy module properly.

3. Which type of programming language is read and converted to machine code before runtime, allowing for more efficient code?

> Compiled language

4. Which of the following is not an IDE or code editor?

> pip

5. What does the PATH variable do?

> Tells the operating system where to find executables
