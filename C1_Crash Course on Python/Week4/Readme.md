# Strings, Lists and Dictionaries

In this module you'll dive into more advanced ways to manipulate strings using indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. You'll also explore the more advanced data types: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. You'll learn to store, reference, and manipulate data in these structures, as well as combine them to store complex data structures.

## Learning Objectives

### Practice Quiz - Strings

1. Fill in the blanks to complete the is_palindrome function. This function checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that contains the same letters in the same order, whether the word is read from left to right or right to left. Examples of palindromes are words like kayak and radar, and phrases like "Never Odd or Even". The function should ignore blank spaces and capitalization when checking if the given string is a palindrome. Complete this function to return True if the passed string is a palindrome, False if not. 

```python
def is_palindrome(input_string):
    # Two variables are initialized as string date types using empty 
    # quotes: "reverse_string" to hold the "input_string" in reverse
    # order and "new_string" to hold the "input_string" minus the 
    # spaces between words, if any are found.
    new_string = ""
    reverse_string = ""

    # Complete the for loop to iterate through each letter of the
    # "input_string"
    for letter in input_string:

        # The if-statement checks if the "letter" is not a space.
        if letter != " ":

            # If True, add the "letter" to the end of "new_string" and
            # to the front of "reverse_string". If False (if a space
            # is detected), no action is needed. Exit the if-block.
            new_string += letter
            reverse_string = letter + reverse_string

    # Complete the if-statement to compare the "new_string" to the
    # "reverse_string". Remember that Python is case-sensitive when
    # creating the string comparison code. 
    if new_string.lower() == reverse_string.lower():

        # If True, the "input_string" contains a palindrome.
        return True
		
    # Otherwise, return False.
    return False
	

print(is_palindrome("Never Odd or Even")) # Should be True
print(is_palindrome("abc")) # Should be False
print(is_palindrome("kayak")) # Should be True
```

2. Using the format method, fill in the gaps in the convert_distance function so that it returns the phrase "X miles equals Y km", with Y having only 1 decimal place. For example, convert_distance(12) should return "12 miles equals 19.2 km".

```python
def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6 
	result = "{} miles equals {:.1f} km".format(miles, km)
	return result

print(convert_distance(12)) # Should be: 12 miles equals 19.2 km
print(convert_distance(5.5)) # Should be: 5.5 miles equals 8.8 km
print(convert_distance(11)) # Should be: 11 miles equals 17.6 km
```

3. If we have a string variable named Weather = "Rainfall", which of the following will print the substring "Rain" or all characters before the "f"?

> print(Weather[:4])

4. Fill in the gaps in the nametag function so that it uses the format method to return first_name and the first initial of last_name followed by a period. For example, nametag("Jane", "Smith") should return "Jane S."

```python
def nametag(first_name, last_name):
	return("{} {:.1s}.".format(first_name, last_name))

print(nametag("Jane", "Smith")) 
# Should display "Jane S." 
print(nametag("Francesco", "Rinaldi")) 
# Should display "Francesco R." 
print(nametag("Jean-Luc", "Grand-Pierre")) 
# Should display "Jean-Luc G." 
```

5. The replace_ending function replaces a specified substring at the end of a given sentence with a new substring. If the specified substring does not appear at the end of the given sentence, no action is performed and the original sentence is returned. If there is more than one occurrence of the specified substring in the sentence, only the substring at the end of the sentence is replaced. For example, replace_ending("abcabc", "abc", "xyz") should return abcxyz, not xyzxyz or xyzabc. The string comparison is case-sensitive, so replace_ending("abcabc", "ABC", "xyz") should return abcabc (no changes made).  

```python
def replace_ending(sentence, old, new):
	# Check if the old string is at the end of the sentence 
	if old in sentence[-len(old):]:
		# Using i as the slicing index, combine the part
		# of the sentence up to the matched string at the 
		# end with the new string
		i = sentence.rindex(old)
		new_sentence = sentence[:i] + new
		return new_sentence

	# Return the original sentence if there is no match 
	return sentence
	
print(replace_ending("It's raining cats and cats", "cats", "dogs")) 
# Should display "It's raining cats and dogs"
print(replace_ending("She sells seashells by the seashore", "seashells", "donuts")) 
# Should display "She sells seashells by the seashore"
print(replace_ending("The weather is nice in May", "may", "april")) 
# Should display "The weather is nice in May"
print(replace_ending("The weather is nice in May", "May", "April")) 
# Should display "The weather is nice in April"

```

### Practice Quiz - Lists

1. Given a list of filenames, we want to rename all the files with extension hpp to the extension h. To do this, we would like to generate a new list called newfilenames, consisting of the new filenames. Fill in the blanks in the code using any of the methods you’ve learned thus far, like a for loop or a list comprehension.

```python
filenames = ["program.c", "stdio.hpp", "sample.hpp", "a.out", "math.hpp", "hpp.out"]
# Generate newfilenames as a list containing the new filenames
# using as many lines of code as your chosen method requires.

newfilenames = []
for file in filenames:
    if ".hpp" in file:
        swp = file.replace(".hpp", ".h")
        newfilenames.append(swp)
    else:
        newfilenames.append(file)



print(newfilenames) 
# Should be ["program.c", "stdio.h", "sample.h", "a.out", "math.h", "hpp.out"]
```

2. Let's create a function that turns text into pig latin: a simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. For example, python ends up as ythonpay.

```python
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  # Separate the text into words
  words = text.split()
  new_words = []
  for word in words:
    # Create the pig latin word and add it to the list
    end_p = word[1:] + word[0]
    end_ay = end_p + "ay"
    new_words.append(end_ay)
    say = " ".join(new_words)
    # Turn the list back into a phrase
  return say
		
print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

3. The permissions of a file in a Linux system are split into three sets of three permissions: read, write, and execute for the owner, group, and others. Each of the three values can be expressed as an octal number summing each permission, with 4 corresponding to read, 2 to write, and 1 to execute. Or it can be written with a string using the letters r, w, and x or - when the permission is not granted.
 For example: 
 640 is read/write for the owner, read for the group, and no permissions for the others; converted to a string, it would be: "rw-r-----"
 755 is read/write/execute for the owner, and read/execute for group and others; converted to a string, it would be: "rwxr-xr-x"
 Fill in the blanks to make the code convert a permission in octal format into a string format.
 
 ```python
 def octal_to_string(octal):
    result = ""
    value_letters = [(4,"r"),(2,"w"),(1,"x")]
    # Iterate over each of the digits in octal
    for d in [int(n) for n in str(octal)]:
        # Check for each of the permissions values
        for value, letter in value_letters:
            if d >= value:
                result += letter
                d -= value
            else:
                result += "-"
    return result
    
print(octal_to_string(755)) # Should be rwxr-xr-x
print(octal_to_string(644)) # Should be rw-r--r--
print(octal_to_string(750)) # Should be rwxr-x---
print(octal_to_string(600)) # Should be rw-------
 ```

4. Tuples and lists are very similar types of sequences. What is the main thing that makes a tuple different from a list?

> A tuple is immutable

5. The group_list function accepts a group name and a list of members, and returns a string with the format: group_name: member1, member2, … For example, group_list("g", ["a","b","c"]) returns "g: a, b, c". Fill in the gaps in this function to do that.

```python
def group_list(group, users):
  users1 = ", ".join(users)
  members = f"{group}: {users1}"
  return members

print(group_list("Marketing", ["Mike", "Karen", "Jake", "Tasha"])) # Should be "Marketing: Mike, Karen, Jake, Tasha"
print(group_list("Engineering", ["Kim", "Jay", "Tom"])) # Should be "Engineering: Kim, Jay, Tom"
print(group_list("Users", "")) # Should be "Users:"
```

6. The guest_list function reads in a list of tuples with the name, age, and profession of each party guest, and prints the sentence "Guest is X years old and works as __." for each one. For example, guest_list(('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")) should print out: Ken is 30 years old and works as Chef. Pat is 35 years old and works as Lawyer. Amanda is 25 years old and works as Engineer. Fill in the gaps in this function to do that. 

```python
def guest_list(guests):
	for guest in guests:
		name = guest[0]
		age = guest[1]
		profession = guest[2]
		print("{} is {} years old and works as {}".format(name, age, profession))

guest_list([('Ken', 30, "Chef"), ("Pat", 35, 'Lawyer'), ('Amanda', 25, "Engineer")])

#Click Run to submit code
"""
Output should match:
Ken is 30 years old and works as Chef
Pat is 35 years old and works as Lawyer
Amanda is 25 years old and works as Engineer
"""
```

### Practice Quiz - Dictionaries

1. The email_list function receives a dictionary, which contains domain names as keys, and a list of users as values. Fill in the blanks to generate a list that contains complete email addresses (e.g. diana.prince@gmail.com).

```python
def email_list(domains):
	emails = []
	for key, users in domains.items():
	  for user in users:
	    emails.append(user + "@" + key)
	return(emails)

print(email_list({"gmail.com": ["clark.kent", "diana.prince", "peter.parker"], "yahoo.com": ["barbara.gordon", "jean.grey"], "hotmail.com": ["bruce.wayne"]}))
```

2. The groups_per_user function receives a dictionary, which contains group names with the list of users. Users can belong to multiple groups. Fill in the blanks to return a dictionary with the users as keys and a list of their groups as values.

```python
def groups_per_user(group_dictionary):
	user_groups = {}
	# Go through group_dictionary
	for group, users in group_dictionary.items():
		# Now go through the users in the group
		for user in users:
			# Now add the group to the the list of
			user_groups[user] = []
			if user not in user_groups:
				user_groups[user] = group
			else:
				user_groups[user].append(group)

	return(user_groups)


def groups_per_user(group_dictionary):
	user_groups = {}
	# Go through group_dictionary
	for group, users in group_dictionary.items():
		# Now go through the users in the group
		for user in users:
			if user not in user_groups:
				user_groups[user] = []
			user_groups[user].append(group)
			# Now add the group to the the list of
# groups for this user, creating the entry
# in the dictionary if necessary

	return(user_groups)

print(groups_per_user({"local": ["admin", "userA"],
		"public":  ["admin", "userB"],
		"administrator": ["admin"] }))
```
3. The dict.update method updates one dictionary with the items coming from the other dictionary, so that existing entries are replaced and new entries are added. What is the content of the dictionary “wardrobe“ at the end of the following code?

```python
wardrobe = {'shirt': ['red', 'blue', 'white'], 'jeans': ['blue', 'black']}
new_items = {'jeans': ['white'], 'scarf': ['yellow'], 'socks': ['black', 'brown']}
wardrobe.update(new_items)
```

> {'shirt': ['red', 'blue', 'white'], 'jeans': ['white'], 'scarf': ['yellow'], 'socks': ['black', 'brown']}

4. What’s a major advantage of using dictionaries over lists?

> It’s quicker and easier to find a specific element in a dictionary

5. The add_prices function returns the total price of all of the groceries in the  dictionary. Fill in the blanks to complete this function.

```python
def add_prices(basket):
	# Initialize the variable that will be used for the calculation
	total = 0
	# Iterate through the dictionary items
	for item, price in basket.items():
		# Add each price to the total calculation
		# Hint: how do you access the values of
		# dictionary items?
		total += price
	# Limit the return value to 2 decimal places
	return round(total, 2)  

groceries = {"bananas": 1.56, "apples": 2.50, "oranges": 0.99, "bread": 4.59, 
	"coffee": 6.99, "milk": 3.39, "eggs": 2.98, "cheese": 5.44}

print(add_prices(groceries)) # Should print 28.44

```
