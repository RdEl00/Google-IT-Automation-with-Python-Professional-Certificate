# Hello Python!

In this module we’ll introduce you to the Coursera platform and the course format. Then, we’ll dive into the basics of programming languages and syntax, as well as automation using scripting. We’ll also introduce you to the Python programming language and some of the benefits it offers. Last up, we’ll cover some basic functions and keywords of the language, along with some arithmetic operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Define the terms computer program, programming language, script, and automation
- Use the print() function to output data to the screen
- Explain the difference between the syntax and semantics of a programming language
- List some of the characteristics of the Python language
- Utilize basic Python arithmetic operators to obtain the results of mathematical expressions

### Practice Quiz - Introduction to Python

1. Fill in the correct Python command to put “My first Python program” onto the screen.

```python
print("My first Python program")
```

2. Python is an example of what type of programming language?

>  General purpose scripting language 

3. Convert this Bash command into Python:

```python
print("Have a nice day")
```

4. Fill in the correct Python commands to put “This is fun!” onto the screen 5 times. 

```python
for i in range(5):
  print("This is fun!")
```
5. Select the Python code snippet that corresponds to the following Javascript snippet:

```python
for i in range(10):

```

### Practice Quiz - Hello World

1. What are functions in Python?

> Functions are pieces of code that perform a unit of work.

2. What are keywords in Python?

> Keywords are reserved words that are used to construct instructions.

3. What does the print function do in Python?

> The print function outputs messages to the screen

4. Output a message that says "Programming in Python is fun!" to the screen.

```python
print("Programming in Python is fun!")
```

5. Replace the ___ placeholder and calculate the Golden ratio: 

```math
1 + \sqrt{3}
```

*Tip: to calculate the square root of a number xx, you can use x**(1/2).*

```python
ratio = ((1+5**(1/2)))/2
print(ratio)
```
