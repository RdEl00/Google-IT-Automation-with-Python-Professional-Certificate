# Final Project

In this module, you'll learn how to apply a problem-solving framework to tackle a challenging project. You'll learn how to formulate a problem statement to understand a challenge, conduct some research to see what options are available, then begin planning how you to solve a problem.

## Learning Objectives

- Tackle more complex problems from the ground up using a framework
- Formulate a problem statement to understand the inputs and outputs of a script
- Conduct research into options for tackling the problem
- Plan an approach to solving the problem
- Write a complex script in order to implement a solution

## Problem Statement

Imagine that you're an IT specialist working in a medium-sized company, your manager wants to create a daily report that tracks the use of machines. Specifically, she wants to know which users are currently connected to which machines, it's your job to create the report. In your company, there's a system that collects every event that happens on the machines on the network. Among the many events collected it records each time a user logs in or out of a computer. With this information, we want to write a script that generates a report of which users are logged in to which machines at that time.
